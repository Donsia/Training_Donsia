18.	The following program tells us we have an undefined variable, but our only variable name is counter. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define RECIPROCAL (number) (1.0 / (number))
main()
}
float counter;
for (counter = 0.0; counter < 10.0;
counter += 1.0)
cout << "1/" << counter << " = "<<
RECIPROCAL(counter) << "\n";
}
return (0);
}

ANS:
  Space exists between RECIPROCAL and (number) // RECIPROCAL (number)
  So,the compiler will consider number as an undefined one
  Removing space will make it work properly
