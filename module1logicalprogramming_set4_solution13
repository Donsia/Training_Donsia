13.	The following program generates the answer 47 instead of the expected answer 144. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define FIRST_PART 7
#define LAST_PART 5
#define ALL_PARTS FIRST_PART + LAST_PART
main()
{
cout << "The square of all the parts is " <<
ALL_PARTS * ALL_PARTS << '\n';
return (0);
}

ANS:
  Since,there is no paranthesis in the macro defined,the statement will be executed as
      ALL_PARTS = FIRST_PART + LAST_PART=7 + 5
      ALL_PARTS * ALL_PARTS = 7 + 5 * 7 + 5
      // OPERATOR PRECEDENCE:
                           5 * 7 =35
                           7 + 35 + 5 = 47
