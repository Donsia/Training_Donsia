16.	The following program is supposed to print the message "Fatal Error:
Abort" and exit when it receives bad data. But when it gets good data, it exits. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
 #include <stdlib.h> /* ANSI Standard only */

 #define DIE \
 cerr << "Fatal Error: Abort\n"; exit(8);

 main() {
 // A random value for testing
 int value;

 value = 1;
 if (value < 0)
 DIE;

 cerr << "We did not die\n";
 return (0);
 }


ANS:
  Here,value 1 is a good data,it should prints "We did not die"
  But,without braces there are two statements after if statement
  compiler might get confused as there are no braces 
  if statement here requires braces.
