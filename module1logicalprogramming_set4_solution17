17.	What does the above program output? (Try running it on your machine.). Why did it output what it did? (Try checking the output of the preprocessor.)

#include <iostream.h>
#define SQR(x) ((x) * (x))
main ()
{
int counter; /* Counter for loop */
counter = 0;
while (counter < 5)
cout << "x << counter + 1 <<
" x squared" << SQR(++counter) << '\n';
return (0);
}

ANS:
  Inside cout,execution happens from right to left,So SQR(X)will works first,
  In the first pass,it perform as 1 * 2 // value of x is ++counter everytime,SQR(++counter)
  squared x is 2
  Now,x will be counter + 1= 2 + 1 = 3;
  In the second pass,it will be 3 * 4 = 12,
  x will be 4 + 1 = 5;
  In third,5 * 6 = 30 and x will be 6 + 1 = 7;
  SO,it outputs x 3,5,7 and x square as 2 ,12,30
