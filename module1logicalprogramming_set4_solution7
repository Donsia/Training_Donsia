7.	Why does the following program fail to print the correct zip code? What does
it print instead?

long int zip; // Zip code
main()
{
zip = 02137L; // Use the zip code for Cambridge MA
cout << "New York's zip code is: " << zip << '\n';
return(0);
}

ANS:
   Since,input is in octal representation,compiler fails to print it in octal format.
   It will print the decimal equivalent of 02137L
     02137=1119
