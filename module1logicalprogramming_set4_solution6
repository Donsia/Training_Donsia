6.	Explain auto, register, static and extern variables.

ANS:
auto
   auto is the default storage class.
   It applies to local variables only and the variable is visible only inside the function in which it is declared. 
   It dies as soon as the function execution is over. If not initialized, variables of class auto contains garbage value.
      int number;    // by default,storage class here is auto
      auto int number;
      
register
   Variables of class register are stored in CPU registers instead of memory.
   The scope of the variable is local to the function in which it is defined and it dies as soon as the function execution is over. 
   It contains some garbage value if not initialized.
      reg int number;
      
static
   The scope of static variable is local to the function in which it is defined but it doesn't die when the function execution is over. 
   The value of a static variable persists between function calls. 
   The default initial value of static variable is 0
      static int number=5;
   
extern
   Variables of extern storage class have a global scope. 
   We use extern variables when we want a variable to be visible outside the file in which it is declared.
   So, an extern variable can be shared across multiple files. 
   An extern variable remains alive as long as program execution continues. 
   A static global variable is visible only in the file it is declared but an extern global variable is visible across all the files of a program.
      extern int number;
