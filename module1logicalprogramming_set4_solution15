15.	This Example computes the wrong value for size. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define SIZE 10;
#define FUDGE SIZE -2;
main ()
{
int size; // Size to really use
size = FUDGE;
cout << "Size is " << size << '\n';
return (0);
}

ANS:
  Semicolon in the macro might be the reason for the wrong value.
  ; in the end is the representation  to do nothing.
  Therefore,size computes the wrong value
