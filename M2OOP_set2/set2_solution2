class MobilePhone
{
protected:
void calling();
void sendSms();
};
class N1400:public MobilePhone
{
//inherits the properties of base
//only features of N1400 is call & sms
};
class N2700:public MobilePhone
{
protected:
void Fmradio();
void Mp3();
void Camera();
};
class B:MobilePhone
{
protected:
void Fmradio();
void Mp3();
void camera();
void recording();
void read_send_mails();
};

The common features of all the classes are call and sms.Therefore,that two feautures are kept in a base class
The derived classes are inheriting the common feature from the base.
Hence,Abstraction is used here.
