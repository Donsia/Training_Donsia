14.	This program generates a warning that counter is used before it is set.
This is a surprise because the for loop should set it. You also get a very strange warning, "null effect, "for line 11.
 // Warning, spacing is VERY important

 #include <iostream.h>

 #define MAX 10

 main()
 {
 int counter;

 for (counter = MAX; counter > 0;
 --counter)
 cout << "Hi there\n";

 return (0);
 }

ANS:
  I hope this will print " Hi there " until the condition fails inside the loop.
