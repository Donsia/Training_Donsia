19.	In the following program, the HIGH_SPEED flag works, but the DIRECT_CONNECT flag does not. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
const int HIGH_SPEED = (1<<7); /* modem is running fast */
// we are using a hardwired connection
const int DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8);
char flags = 0; // start with nothing
main()
{
flags |= HIGH_SPEED; // we are running fast
flags |= DIRECT_CONNECT; // because we are wired together
if ((flags & HIGH_SPEED) != 0)
cout <<"High speed set\n";
if ((flags & DIRECT_CONNECT) != 0)
cout <<"Direct connect set\n";
return (0);
}

ANS:
 const int HIGH_SPEED = (1<<7)=10000000=128
 const int DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8)=100000000=256
 flag=flag|HIGH_SPEED ,    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                           1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ( | )
                           -----------------
                           1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
   Here,flag = 128
 flag=flag|DIRECT_CONNECT,
                           1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ( | )
                         -------------------
                         1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
                  We declared flag as a character datatype,here,flag value goes beyond the range,
                  so that the last bit will be discarded,and flag again is 128
       
       Now,coming to if statement,performing & operation between flag and highspeed,
                         1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ( & )
                         ----------------
                         1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                         
                  As the result is non zero,if((flags & HIGH_SPEED) != 0),condition true
                  So,High speed set
       
       In the second if statement,performing & operation between flag and direct connect,
                         1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                       1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  ( & )
                       ------------------
                       0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                       
                 Here,the result is zero,and so condition is false,
                 Therefore,Direct flag failed to set
