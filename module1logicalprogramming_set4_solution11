11.	What is the error in this program?
#include <iostream.h>
/*
* This program produces a Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
* chart for the numbers 0 to 100.
*
* Restrictions:
* This program deals with integers only, so the
* calculations may not be exact.
*/
// The current Celsius temperature we are working with
int celsius;
main() {
for (celsius = 0; celsius <= 100; ++celsius);
cout << "Celsius: " << celsius <<
" Fahrenheit: " << ((celsius * 9) / 5 + 32) << '\n';
return (0);
}
When run, this program prints out:
Celsius: 101 Fahrenheit: 213
and nothing more. Why?

ANS:
  Semicolon at the end of for loop could be the reason for this.
  Loop runs until the condition fails,but it makes no effect because of semicolon.
  Only once the statement after for loop is executed and so it prints celsius as 101 and Fahrenheit as 213
