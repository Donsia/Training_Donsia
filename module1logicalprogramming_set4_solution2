//2.	Why does this program print ''The value of 1/3 is 0"? What must be done to this
// program to fix it?

#include <iostream.h>
float answer; // the result of the divide
main ()
{
answer = 1/3;
cout << "The value of 1/3 is " << answer << "\n";
return (0);
}

ANS:
  both 1 and 3 are integers,it will work as integer division.
  therefore,result will be 0
  Making atleast one integer as float will fix the bug here.
  answer=1.0/3
  answer=0.333333
