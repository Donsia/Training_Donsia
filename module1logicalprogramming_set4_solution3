/* 3.	Example is designed to compute the area of a triangle, given its width
and height. For some strange reason, the compiler refuses to believe that we declared the variable width. The declaration is right there on line two, just after the definition of
height. Why isn't the compiler seeing it? */

#include <iostream.h>
int height; /* the height of the triangle
int width; /* the width of the triangle */
int area; /* area of the triangle (computed) */
main()
{
cout << "Enter width height? ";
cin >> width >> height;
area = (width * height) / 2;
cout << "The area is " << area << '\n';
return (0);
}

/*ANS:
    Here,/* starts a comment at the end of height declaration but ends with */ only after width declaration.
    Therefore,compiler will refuses to accept width as a declared variable.
    It will consider the line in which width is declared as a comment.
    if comment would have closed at height declaration like /* the height of the triangle */ then it will accept width as a variable declared.
